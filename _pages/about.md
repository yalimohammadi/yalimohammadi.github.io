I am a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in the  [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am advised by [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). 
Before coming to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).





My research involves leveraging data to guide decision-making using network data. Specifically, I develop algorithms and optimization techniques to study the behavior of networks in practical applications. My work has two main focuses: first, I investigate the spread of epidemics on networks, and second, I design efficient sampling algorithms for large networks. In addition, my research provides valuable insights into the functioning of online platforms such as matching markets and online advertising markets. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of more effective and informed decision-making strategies.







### Outreach
I was a mentor 2019-2021 and an organizing board member 2020-2021  in Stanford Women in Math Mentoring ([SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/)), a mentoring program for undergraduates coming from minority backgrounds interested in math and computational sciences. Also, I mentored undergraduates in [Stanford directed reading program]() and [MS&E Undergraduate Diversity in Research](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research?authuser=0).
