Hey! I'm Yeganeh, a third year PhD student in [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). 
I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and its intersection with economics and health policy. 

Before coming to Stanford, I received BSc in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/). There I was lucky to work with [Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh](http://sharif.edu/~zarrabi/) on maximum bicliques in convex graphs. 

I have been a mentor since 2019 and an organizer since 2020  for Stanford Women in Math Mentoring ([SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/)), a mentoring program for undergraduates interested in math and computational sciences with the goal to reduce the gender gap.

I am also an organizing board member of [Persian Student Association](https://psa.stanford.edu/), where we organize events to promote an understanding of Persian culture, to help foster friendship among different cultural groups, and to provide a source of support for the Persian community at Stanford.
