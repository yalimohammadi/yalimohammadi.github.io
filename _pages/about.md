Hey! I'm Yeganeh, a fouth-year PhD student in [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). 
Before coming to Stanford, I received BSc in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).

My research is in studying networks and its applications to health policy and economics. In particular, I have worked on studying random processes on networks, sampling from networks, and optimization problems on top of them. My work combines ideas from computer science, probability theory, and operations research to provide theoretical understanding for real-life problems.

# Outreach
I have been a mentor since 2019 and a board member since 2020  for Stanford Women in Math Mentoring ([SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/)), a mentoring program for undergraduates interested in math and computational sciences with the goal to reduce the gender gap. Also, I am fortunate to mentroing undergraduate mentees through [SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/), [Stanford directed reading program](), and [MS&E Undergraduate Diversity in Research](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research?authuser=0). I was also a board member of [Persian Student Association](https://psa.stanford.edu/), where we organized events to help foster friendship among different cultural groups.
