I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in the  [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am advised by [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). 
Before coming to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/). In 2022, I was a research fellow at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/graph2022">Simons Institute Theory for Computing</a>, and I interned at Google Research, hosted by Aranyak Mehta.

**Exciting News**: I will be a President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by Christian Borgs. Starting in the summer of 2025, I will join the USC Marshall School of Business as an Assistant Professor of Data Sciences and Operations.

My research centers on learning and decision-making using network data. From a theoretical perspective, I integrate tools from applied probability, algorithms, and the theory of graph limits. 
On the practical front, I am inspired by addressing tangible real-world challenges in business operations, such as healthcare and online markets, that can be modeled and analyzed using network data.

    It’s pronounced ‘Yeay gone eh’—- say it swiftly, allowing the second ‘y’ to gracefully blend. To break it down, start with ‘Yeay!’ as if you just cracked a challenging problem, followed by ‘gone’ as in something mysteriously disappeared, and end with ‘eh’ like you’re asking a thoughtful question. Thanks for taking the time to get it right!

### Outreach
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

During 2019-2021, I was a mentor and an organizing board member for Stanford Women in Math Mentoring  ([SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/)), a program supporting undergraduates from diverse backgrounds with a passion for math and computational sciences. I also mentored undergraduates in [Stanford's Math Directed Reading Program](https://mathdrp.stanford.edu/) and [MS&E Undergraduate Diversity in Research](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research?authuser=0).
