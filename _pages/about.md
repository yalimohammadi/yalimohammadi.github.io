I am a UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Christian Borgs](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/borgs.html). I recently completed my Ph.D. at Stanford University in the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the Department of Management Science & Engineering, where I was advised by [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). During my Ph.D., I spent a semester at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/graph2022) as a research fellow.
Before coming to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/). 

Starting in the summer of 2025, I will join the USC Marshall School of Business as an Assistant Professor of Data Sciences and Operations.

My research centers on learning and decision-making using network data. From a theoretical perspective, I integrate tools from applied probability, algorithms, and the theory of graph limits. On the practical side, I am driven by real-world challenges in business operations, such as healthcare and online markets, that can be modeled and analyzed using network data.

    It’s pronounced ‘Yeay gone eh’—- say it swiftly, allowing the second ‘y’ to gracefully blend. To break it down, start with ‘Yeay!’ as if you just cracked a challenging problem, followed by ‘gone’ as in something mysteriously disappeared, and end with ‘eh’ like you’re asking a thoughtful question. Thanks for taking the time to get it right!
