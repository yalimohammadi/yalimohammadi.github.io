I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in the  [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within the department of Management Science & Engineering, where I am advised by [Amin Saberi](http://stanford.edu/~saberi/). 
Before coming to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).




My research centers on learning and decision-making using network data. On the theoretical side, I employ tools from applied probability, algorithms, and the theory of graph limits.
My research questions are deeply motivated by real-world challenges that can be effectively modeled and analyzed using networks, focusing on addressing issues in healthcare and online markets.


**I'm on the 2023-2024 academic job market.**

### Outreach
---


During 2019-2021, I was a mentor and an organizing board member for Stanford Women in Math Mentoring  ([SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/)), a program supporting undergraduates from diverse backgrounds with a passion for math and computational sciences. I also mentored undergraduates in [Stanford directed reading program]() and [MS&E Undergraduate Diversity in Research](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research?authuser=0).
